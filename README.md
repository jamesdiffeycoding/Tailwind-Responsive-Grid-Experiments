# Tailwind Responsive Grid

## Inspiration
Thus far I've always enjoyed making projects in plain old CSS, but, like many other front end devs, I've heard a lot about Tailwind of late. **Is Tailwind worth all the hype? I wanted to know.**

## What it does
This app is a simple demonstration of a responsive grid layout in tailwind css.

## How we built it
This project was built with Tailwind, HTML, and media queries.

## Challenges we ran into
Tailwind clashes with default CSS styling.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
My first project using Tailwind.

## What I learned
I learned to be careful of clashes between CSS and Tailwind styling, and better understand the trade-offs between Tailwind and CSS. I also realised that in some dev environments, your local live server may not update without you restarting it if you start a tailwind project and make changes to any css files.

## What's next?
I'd like to try more complicated projects with Tailwind.
